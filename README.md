# odin-recipes

In this project for the Odin Project, I've put what I've learned about the basics of HTML into action, including:

- "Boilerplate" code
- Use of basic elements, including but not limited to links, images and lists

I've also included some basic CSS to change colours and fonts, and adjust the positioning of images.
